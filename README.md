## Functions

The functions of piglow are:

```python
from piglow import PiGlow
piglow = PiGlow([0/1])
piglow.colour([1-6],[0-255])    # 1= White, 2= Blue, 3= Green, 4= Yellow, 5= Orange, 6= Red
piglow.white([0-255])           # Control all the white LEDs
piglow.blue([0-255])            # Control all the blue LEDs
piglow.green([0-255])           # Control all the green LEDs
piglow.yellow([0-255])          # Control all the yellow LEDs
piglow.orange([0-255])          # Control all the orange LEDs
piglow.red([0-255])             # Control all the red LEDs
piglow.all([0-255])             # Control all LEDs together
piglow.led([1-18],[0-255])      # Control an individual LED by number
piglow.led1-led18([0-255])      # Control an individual LED by function
piglow.arm([1-3],[0-255])       # Control an arm of LEDs by number
piglow.arm1([0-255])            # Control the top arm (with PiGlow logo at the top)
piglow.arm2([0-255])            # Control the right arm (with PiGlow logo at the top)
piglow.arm3([0-255])            # Control the left arm (with PiGlow logo at the top)
```

All colours are from 0 (off) to 255 (super duper eye numbing bright!)


Enjoy!
